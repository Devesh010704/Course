Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Devesh Tiwari
Dynamic Programming
In this module, I learned how complex problems can be solved by breaking them into smaller overlapping subproblems and storing intermediate results using memoization or tabulation. I understood how dynamic programming improves time complexity compared to brute-force recursion. I also learned to identify optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems, which are key indicators for applying DP. Additionally, I practiced designing efficient solutions while balancing both time and space complexity.
